<!--
Please check the following before submitting a new issue:

1. Make sure you are running the current release of GalliumOS (2.0), if possible
  * See https://wiki.galliumos.org/News/GalliumOS_2.0 for more information
  * Upgrade help is available on Reddit or IRC (see below)
2. Make sure your system is fully updated
  * Run "GalliumOS Update" from the launcher menu, or `galliumos-update` from a Terminal window
3. Search the issue tracker for similar issues
  * Keep all discussion of an issue in a single ticket; duplicates are distracting
  * Please add any additional information you can provide to existing tickets
  * A comment to the effect of "I am also having this problem" is fine, and often useful

If you are creating a new issue report, be sure to include the following:

1. Your Chromebook/Chromebox model hardware ID
  * Check `dmidecode -s system-product-id`, the dev mode screen, or find your model on https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility
2. Your firmware: stock/factory, MattDevo, CoolStar, John Lewis, or other
  * See https://wiki.galliumos.org/Firmware for more information
3. Your installation method (ISO or chrx) and whether you're running a nightly build
4. A detailed description of the problem, and steps to reproduce it

This tracker is primarily for bug reports. Some feature requests are also appropriate.

For support questions, please use our Reddit forum or IRC channel instead (but check the GalliumOS wiki first):

* https://wiki.galliumos.org/
* https://reddit.com/r/GalliumOS
* https://galliumos.org/irc (Freenode #galliumos)

Thank you for helping us make GalliumOS a better place!
